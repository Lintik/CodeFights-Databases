You're going on vacation in a big city, and you've prepared a list of all the sights you'd like to visit. As you don't have much time and can't spend a whole day at one interesting place, you want to visit several sights per day and walk from one site to another. But walking a long distance might be boring, so you won't walk between two places if the distance between them is 5 km or more.

To find the route that you should take, you are going to find all pairs of places that are less than 5 km from each other.

The places of interests are stored in a table __sights__, which has the following attributes:

id: the unique ID of the place;
name: the name of the place;
x: the x coordinate of the place;
y: the y coordinate of the place.
The distance between the places is calculated with the assumption that they are just points on a 2D map.

Given the __sights__ table, find all pairs of places that are less than 5 km from each other and return them as a table with the columns place1 and place2. Sort them in lexicographical order. The places in the pairs should also be sorted lexicographically.

__Example__

For the following table __sights__

|id	name|	x	|y|
|---|---|---|
|1|	Tower of London	|51508.026|	-7.5939|
|2|	Trafalgar Square	|51508.040	|-12.7899|
|3|	London Eye	|51503.538	|-11.9371|
|4|	The Shard|	51504.533	|-8.6028|

the output should be

|place1|	place2|
|---|---|
|London Eye|	The Shard|
|London Eye|	Trafalgar Square|
|The Shard	|Tower of London|
