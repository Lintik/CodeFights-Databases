You're a math teacher at an elementary school. Today you taught your class basic arithmetic operations ("+", "-", "*", "/") and now you need to give the students some homework. You have a lot of expressions in the format a <operation> b = c, where a, b, and c are some integers and operation is one of the operations given above.

Information about these expressions is stored in the table __expressions__, which has the structure:

* id: the unique operation id;
* a: an integer;
* b: an integer;
* operation: one of the operations given above ("+", "-", "*", or "/");
* c: an integer.

The homework you're going to give is simple: For each expression, the student needs to determine whether it's correct or not, i.e. whether it's true that the expression to the left of the = sign equals c.

Since you have many students and checking all their answers manually is a lot of work, you want to streamline the process by automatically identifying all the expressions that are correct. Given the table __expressions__, build the resulting table as follows: The table should have the same columns as the initial table does, but it should only contain those rows that represent correct expressions. The rows should be ordered by id.

__Example__

For the following table __expressions__

|id|	a|	b|	operation|	c|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|	2|	3|	+|	5|
|2|	2|	3|	+|	6|
|3|	3|	2|	/|	1|
|4|	4|	7|	*|	28|
|5|	54|	2|	-|	27|
|6|	3|	0|	/|	0|

the output should be

|id|	a|	b|	operation|	c|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|	2|	3|	+|	5|
|4|	4|	7|	*|	28|

Explanation:

* 2 + 3 = 5 - correct;
* 2 + 3 = 6 - incorrect;
* 3 / 2 = 1 - incorrect;
* 4 * 7 = 28 - correct;
* 54 - 2 = 27 - incorrect;
* 3 / 0 = 0 - incorrect.
